# Extension marketplace

OpenStream no longer hard-codes its sources. Sources are **extensions** published by
**repositories**, browsed in an in-app marketplace, and installed per user.

- Screen: `presentation/marketplace/MarketplaceScreen.kt` (Browse / Installed / Repositories)
- Catalog logic: `data/extensions/`
- Runtime binding: `data/streaming/ExtensionProviderRegistry.kt`
- Official catalog: [`extensions/index.json`](../extensions/index.json), also bundled at
  `app/src/main/assets/extensions/official-repo.json`

## How comparable apps do it

| App | Distribution unit | Discovery | Popularity signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Stremio** | Add-on **manifest** at an HTTP URL (`id`, `version`, `name`, `resources`, `types`, `idPrefixes`, `catalogs`, `behaviorHints`). The client owns the runtime; the add-on only answers protocol requests. | Official add-on catalog in-app, plus community directories that list, search, categorise and rank add-ons. | Community directory ranking / votes — not an app-internal count. |
| **CloudStream** | `.cs3` plugin **binaries** referenced from `repo.json` → `pluginLists` → `plugins.json` entries (`internalName`, `url`, `version`, `apiVersion`, `status`, `authors`, `tvTypes`, `iconUrl`, `fileSize`, `fileHash`). | Users paste a repository URL; the app lists every plugin from every linked list. | `status` health flag and curated repo lists; no install counts. |
| **Mihon / Aniyomi** | Extension **APKs** described by a flat `index.min.json` (`name`, `pkg`, `apk`, `lang`, `code`, `version`, `nsfw`, `sources[]`). | Users add repository URLs; extensions are filtered by language and NSFW flag. | None — plain alphabetical listing. |

## What OpenStream took from each

- **From Stremio:** extensions are *declarative data*, not code. A manifest selects an engine that
  already ships in the APK and configures it. A third-party repository therefore cannot execute
  anything on the device — the biggest safety problem with the CloudStream/Mihon binary model.
- **From CloudStream:** the repository shape (`name`, `description`, `manifestVersion`,
  `extensionLists` indirection), the `status` health codes (0 down, 1 ok, 2 slow, 3 beta), the
  `apiVersion` compatibility gate, and "paste a URL to add a repository".
- **From Mihon/Aniyomi:** a bare JSON array is also a valid index, and language is a first-class
  filter.
- **New here:** store-style discovery — top charts, popularity/trending/rating/recency sorts,
  category chips, search, update badges with *Update all*, and a per-device reliability signal.

## Repository format (`manifestVersion: 1`)

```json
{
  "manifestVersion": 1,
  "name": "OpenStream Official",
  "description": "Sources maintained alongside the app",
  "website": "https://github.com/Ivorisnoob/OpenStream",
  "extensionLists": ["https://example.com/more-extensions.json"],
  "extensions": [
    {
      "id": "yoru",
      "name": "Yoru",
      "description": "Primary route with the broadest episode coverage.",
      "version": "1.1.0",
      "versionCode": 2,
      "apiVersion": 1,
      "authors": ["OpenStream"],
      "language": "Multi",
      "iconUrl": "https://example.com/yoru.png",
      "tags": ["movies", "series", "fast"],
      "status": 1,
      "nsfw": false,
      "installs": 0,
      "installsLast7Days": 0,
      "rating": 0,
      "ratingCount": 0,
      "updatedAt": "2026-08-29",
      "homepage": "https://example.com",
      "fallback": false,
      "installedByDefault": true,
      "engine": {
        "type": "vidking-direct",
        "endpoint": "cdn/sources-with-title",
        "priority": 0,
        "language": null,
        "qualityFilter": null
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Accepted document shapes:

1. the object above (inline `extensions`, and/or `extensionLists` pointing at more files);
2. `{ "extensions": [ … ] }`;
3. a bare `[ … ]` array of entries.

A malformed entry is skipped rather than failing the whole index. Repository URLs are normalised —
a `github.com/…/blob/…` link becomes a `raw.githubusercontent.com` link, and a bare project link
falls back to `main/extensions/index.json`.

### Engines

| `engine.type` | Backed by | Required fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vidking-direct` | `VidkingDirectProvider` | `endpoint`; optional `language`, `qualityFilter`, `priority` |
| `vidking-webview` | `WebEmbedResolver` with the built-in Vidking page (slow compatibility resolver) | none |
| `web-embed` | `WebEmbedResolver` (hidden WebView that records the player's media requests) | `movieUrl` and/or `tvUrl` (https templates using `{tmdbId}`, `{imdbId}`, `{season}`, `{episode}`); optional `priority` |
| `resolver-api` | `ResolverApiProvider` (declarative HTTP lookup → optional details → playback resolver) | `endpoint` (HTTPS base URL) and `engine.resolver.playback`; optional `search` / `details` stages and JSON response paths |

#### Resolver API engine

`resolver-api` is the new engine for providers whose architecture is closer to a resolver service than a
single embed page. It is intentionally generic: the APK implements the HTTP/runtime once, while a
repository entry supplies endpoint paths and JSON field mappings.

The resolution pipeline is:

```
MediaIdentity
   ↓
optional search (title / ids / year)
   ↓
providerId
   ↓
optional details(providerId)
   ↓
playback(providerId + season + episode)
   ↓
streams + subtitles
```

A resolver manifest can use relative paths against `engine.endpoint` or absolute HTTPS URLs:

```json
{
  "engine": {
    "type": "resolver-api",
    "endpoint": "https://api.example.com",
    "priority": 15,
    "resolver": {
      "search": {
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "/search",
        "query": {
          "q": "{title}",
          "year": "{year}"
        }
      },
      "details": {
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "/title/{providerId}"
      },
      "playback": {
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "/play/{providerId}",
        "query": {
          "season": "{season}",
          "episode": "{episode}"
        }
      },
      "response": {
        "searchItemsPath": "results",
        "providerIdPath": "id",
        "titlePath": "title",
        "yearPath": "year",
        "streamsPath": "streams",
        "streamUrlPath": "url",
        "qualityPath": "quality",
        "languagePath": "language",
        "audioPath": "audio",
        "mimeTypePath": "mimeType",
        "subtitlesPath": "subtitles",
        "subtitleUrlPath": "url",
        "subtitleLabelPath": "label"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Supported placeholders are `{tmdbId}`, `{imdbId}`, `{title}`, `{originalTitle}`, `{year}`,
`{season}`, `{episode}`, `{providerId}`, and `{details}`.

The resolver supports JSON arrays/objects, simple dotted paths and array indexes such as
`results[0].id`. Search results are ranked locally by title similarity and year distance before
the provider id is used for playback.

Only public/authorized HTTPS resolver services should be published. The engine does not implement
provider-specific credential extraction, encrypted payload cracking, JavaScript execution, or
anti-bot bypasses. If a provider requires one of those, it needs a separately reviewed native
adapter rather than putting those mechanisms into a repository JSON file.


| `anikoto` | `AnikotoProvider` (site search, MAL-id check, megaplay embeds via `MegaplayExtractor`) | `endpoint`: the site origin (`https://…`) |
| `reanime` | `ReAnimeProvider` (megaplay by AniList id; the site is the Referer) | `endpoint`: the site origin |
| `animepahe` | `AnimePaheProvider` (Cloudflare cleared in a hidden WebView by `CloudflareClearance`, kwik packed-script unpacking) | `endpoint`: the site origin |

The three anime engines resolve only titles that `AnimeEpisodeMapper` can map to an AniList
episode (ani.zip by TMDB id, then AniList sequels, matched by TVDB season/episode or air date);
everything else returns no servers. Each returns sub and dub streams when the site has them.

`web-embed` entries should be published with `"fallback": true`: they load third-party pages in an
off-screen browser, which is slow, so they run only when the direct routes return nothing or every
direct link fails to play. They depend on undocumented pages that change without notice, which is
why they live in the catalog (status `3`, Beta, until proven) rather than in code.

Anything else parses but is listed as **Unsupported** and cannot be installed, which is how the
catalog stays forward-compatible: publishing an entry for a future engine does not break old builds.
`apiVersion` above `EXTENSION_API_VERSION` is gated the same way.

### Ranking

`MarketplaceRanker` blends publisher signals with local evidence:

- `installs` (log-scaled) and `rating` when the publisher reports them;
- `status`, as a multiplier — a source flagged **down** sinks below a healthy one;
- `engine.priority` as curation order, so a repository that publishes **no** telemetry still ranks
  sensibly. The official repository publishes no install counts, because the app collects none;
- the device's own success rate per extension, recorded by `StreamingRepositoryImpl` on every
  resolve and decayed so recent behaviour dominates.

Trending additionally weights `installsLast7Days` and how recently the entry was updated.

## Runtime

`ExtensionProviderRegistry` turns installed + enabled manifests into `StreamProvider`s at resolve
time, so adding a source is a data change in an index — no Dagger module edit, no app release.
Provider ids are unchanged (`vidking-<extension id>`), so saved server preferences and existing
download records keep working, and the pre-marketplace on/off state is migrated on first launch.

For the official repository the APK's bundled copy is reconciled with the fetched one per entry:
the higher `versionCode` wins and entries only the APK knows are kept, so a new build's sources work
before the published index catches up. To retire a bundled entry, publish it with a higher
`versionCode`.

## Contributing to the official catalog

Step-by-step instructions, catalog rules and the review checklist are in
[`extensions/README.md`](../extensions/README.md).

## Publishing a repository

1. Host a JSON document in one of the shapes above (GitHub raw is fine).
2. In the app: **Settings → Extension marketplace → Repositories → Add repository**.
3. Bump `versionCode` when an entry changes; installed users get an **Update** badge.
