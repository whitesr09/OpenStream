**Movies, series and anime in one native Android app.**

quality switching, subtitles, dubs, downloads and picture-in-picture.

## Features

**Discover**
- A Home screen with a trending carousel, a top 10, new episodes this week, and popular movies,
  series and anime
- Search that runs as you type, with filters, genres, trending picks and recent searches
- Title pages with seasons and episodes, cast, trailers and similar titles

**Watch**
- Continue watching: resume from the exact spot, and the next episode is lined up for you
- Auto-play the next episode, and watched marks on episodes you've finished
- Switch quality in the player (up to 4K where the source has it)
- Subtitles in many languages, from the stream or from OpenSubtitles
- Pick the audio: original, dub, or another language when a source carries it
- A mini player keeps the video going while you browse, and picture-in-picture works outside the app

**Keep**
- Download a single episode or a whole season, with pause, resume and retry, and play it offline
- Saved and History, each with its own search, filters and sorting
- In-app updates: check GitHub for a new release, then download and install it without leaving the app

**Feel**
- Material 3 Expressive design with dynamic color on Android 12 and up
- A themed app icon that follows your wallpaper colors
- Layouts built for phones, tablets and landscape

## How streams work

OpenStream doesn't host any video. Titles and artwork come from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
Streams come from **source extensions** listed in a JSON catalog. The app checks every installed
source in parallel, ranks the results, and plays the best one. If a source fails, it moves on to
the next.

Not every title is available yet, and coverage grows as sources are added. Want to add one? See
the [extension contributor guide](extensions/README.md) and the
[catalog format](docs/EXTENSIONS.md).

## Build from source

You need Android Studio (or JDK 17 and the Android SDK) and a free
[TMDB API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ivorisnoob/OpenStream.git
cd OpenStream
echo "TMDB_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> local.properties
# Optional: your own movie manifest URL (personal library mode)
echo "PERSONAL_LIBRARY_MANIFEST_URL=https://your-server/library.json" >> local.properties
./gradlew installDebug
```

Without a key the app falls back to TMDB's `DEMO_KEY`, which is heavily rate-limited.
